# Plastic-Waste-Predictor

A web application that predicts plastic waste and pollution based on production amounts using machine learning models.

## Features

- Predict plastic waste and pollution based on production amounts
- Interactive visualization with historical data
- Environmental impact analysis using AI
- Two different prediction models: Linear and Polynomial

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Choose between Waste or Pollution prediction
3. Select Model 1 (Linear), Model 2 (Polynomial), Model 3 (Random Forest)
4. Enter the production amount in million tonnes
5. Click 'Predict' to see the results
6. View the prediction on the interactive graph and read the environmental impacts, solutions, and model information
